Understand how to design a secure and functional network architecture on AWS.

Prepare for and actively participate in the GenAI Builder Workshop.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |

| 2   | Start with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): <br>&emsp;- Understand the concept and purpose of a VPC as your private network in the AWS cloud. <br>&emsp;- Learn about CIDR blocks and how to plan your IP address range.<br>&emsp; - Define and differentiate between public subnets and private subnets | 29/09/2025 | 29/09/2025      | <https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/>|
| 3   | Continue with VPC networking components: <br>&emsp;- Study Route Tables and how they control traffic flow between subnets and to external networks. <br>&emsp;- Learn about the Internet Gateway (IGW) for public internet access. <br>&emsp;- Understand the Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.	                         | 30/09/2025 | 30/09/2025      | <https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 4   | Learn VPC security and connectivity:- Understand Security G roups as a stateful firewall at the instance level. <br>&emsp;- Learn about Network ACLs as a stateless firewall at the subnet level. <br>&emsp;- Introduction to VPC Peering for connecting VPCs together. <br>&emsp;- Begin exploring AWS Site-to-Site VPN concepts for hybrid cloud connections. | 01/10/2025 | 01/10/2025      | <https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 5   | - Introduction to VPC Peering for connecting VPCs together. <br>&emsp;- Begin exploring AWS Site-to-Site VPN concepts for hybrid cloud connections.                           | 02/10/2025 | 02/10/2025      | <https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 6   | Attend and complete GenAI Builder Workshop: <br>&emsp;- Document key takeaways and newly acquired skills related to AWS AI services.                                                                         | 03/10/2025 | 03/10/2025      | 


### Week 4 Achievements:

* Built a foundational understanding of Amazon VPC, including its role as an isolated virtual network and the purpose of CIDR blocks for IP planning.

* Mastered key VPC components: Learned to create and configure public subnets (with routes to an IGW) and private subnets (with routes to a NAT Gateway), and understood how Route Tables direct traffic.

* Gained knowledge of VPC security: Differentiated between Security Groups (for instance-level, stateful protection) and Network ACLs (for subnet-level, stateless rule sets).

* Explored advanced connectivity: Was introduced to VPC Peering for internal AWS connectivity and began learning about AWS Site-to-Site VPN for connecting to on-premises networks.

* Successfully prepared for and participated in the GenAI Builder Workshop, gaining hands-on experience with AWS's generative AI tools and understanding their integration into cloud architectures.

* Developed initial skills in cloud network design, enabling the planning of a basic, secure multi-tier application architecture using the VPC concepts learned this week.
