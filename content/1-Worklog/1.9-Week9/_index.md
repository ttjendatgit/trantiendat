### Week 9 Objectives:

* Research and identify suitable AWS services for building a weather API.
* Design and finalize the complete API structure using Swagger/OpenAPI specification.
* Collaborate with the Frontend team to align on API design.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **AWS Services Research:** <br> - Research AWS API Gateway for API management and creation. <br> - Identify AWS Lambda as the serverless compute layer. <br> - Review external weather data providers and API integration methods. | 03/11/2025 | 03/11/2025 |
| 2 | **Define API Endpoints & Data Flow:** <br> - Define the 4 core API endpoints <br> - Design request/response schemas for each endpoint. | 04/11/2025 | 04/11/2025 | 
| 3 | **Data Models & External Integration:** <br> - Define the data model for the weather response (temp, humidity, condition, etc.). <br> - Define the data model for the 5-day forecast response. <br> - Research and select a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). <br> - Plan the integration logic within the Lambda function. | 05/11/2025 | 05/11/2025 | 
| 4 | **Swagger/OpenAPI Specification Draft:** <br> - Start writing the Swagger (OpenAPI 3.0) YAML file. <br> - Define the `paths` object with all 4 endpoints. <br> - Specify parameters (path, query) and request examples. <br> - Define the response schemas and examples for success/error cases. | 06/11/2025 | 06/11/2025 | 
| 5 | **Collaboration & Version Control:** <br> - Collaborate with the Frontend team to review and finalize the API endpoints and data models. <br> - Make necessary adjustments to the Swagger spec based on feedback. | 07/11/2025 | 07/11/2025 | 


### Week 9 Achievements:

* Researched and selected AWS API Gateway and Lambda as the foundation for the weather API.
* Designed and documented four core API endpoints for weather data retrieval.
* Successfully collaborated with the Frontend team to align the API design.
