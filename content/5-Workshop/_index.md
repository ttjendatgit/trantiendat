# ONLINE PLATFORM FOR TRACKING AND FORECASTING HURRICANE TRAJECTORY

#### Overview

Hurricanes are powerful natural disasters that cause severe damage to infrastructure and pose significant risks to human life. Early detection and timely warnings are essential so that people in affected areas have enough time to prepare and evacuate safely.

To address this need, our project aims to build an online platform that allows users to freely access information about the most recent storms in the Western Pacific, using data sourced from the trusted NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). In addition, students, meteorologists, or anyone interested in hurricane dynamics can interact with our system by providing their own input trajectories and receiving predictions generated by our machine learning model.

This workshop presents the complete process of building such a model for hurricane forecasting, including several novel time-series techniques—**Stepwise Temporal Fading** and **Plausible Geodesic-Aware Augmentation**—as well as a step-by-step explanation of how we built and deployed the platform from scratch.

With the support of AWS services such as **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudFront**, we construct a fully serverless architecture. This offers simplicity, scalability, and long-term cost efficiency while ensuring reliable and responsive performance.

The final platform delivers two core functionalities:

1. **Storm Viewing**
   Users can explore up-to-date information on recent Western Pacific storms, including their historical path, wind speed, temperature, and other relevant parameters.

2. **Hurricane Trajectory Prediction**
   Users can input their own partial storm trajectory and receive a predicted future path generated by our trained model.
