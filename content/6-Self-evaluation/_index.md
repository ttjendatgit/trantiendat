During my internship at Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd. from September 8, 2025, to December 9, 2025, I gained invaluable experience. I had the opportunity to work with professional platforms and tools, expand my technical knowledge, and, most importantly, received dedicated guidance from mentors and admins, as well as friendly collaboration from peers in the FCJ program.

Through team activities and hands-on projects, I was able to apply and enhance my skills, not only in programming, AWS architecture, and diagram design but also in self-directed research, report writing, and teamwork.

Regarding work ethic, I consistently strived to complete assigned tasks on time, adhered to all regulations, actively communicated with colleagues to optimize work efficiency, and proactively participated in workshops and events organized by the company.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
