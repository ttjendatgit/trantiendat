### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
I was truly surprised and impressed by the professionalism here, from the workspace, location, to the office layout—everything was excellent and a completely new experience for me. During the internship, I had the opportunity to interact with the members of FCJ, who were always enthusiastic, ready to support, and answer any questions, even outside of working hours.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
Whenever I encountered difficulties, the support from mentors and the team admin was always enthusiastic and thorough. They didn't guide me step-by-step from A to Z, but instead offered suggestions like "try doing A this way" or "consider solving it with approach C." This method helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problems and develop my problem-solving skills.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
DevOps was a completely new field for me, and initially, I felt quite overwhelmed, unsure of where to start. However, through learning and hands-on practice, I was able to connect my foundational knowledge with real-world tasks, and I gained valuable experience in a professional working environment.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Learning and development opportunities at FCJ are always open. The company regularly organizes workshops and professional events, allowing interns to gain a better understanding of the work environment, enhance their knowledge, and apply it to real projects. I learned a great deal, not only professionally but also about maintaining a professional work ethic.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture was a highlight, with clear, detailed regulations that made it easy for everyone to understand and follow. FCJ members were always willing to support each other cheerfully and enthusiastically, never hesitating to share experiences. This made me feel like a genuine part of a professional team.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The policies and benefits for interns are excellent, from flexible working hours to organizing professional workshops and events. I not only had the chance to learn from top experts in the field but also received meaningful gifts for participating in activities.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?  
  I hope the process for registering to come to the office can be optimized, for example, through an online registration form where students can select specific days of the week. This would make schedule management clearer, more transparent, and help avoid situations where response  is not received in time.
- Would you like to continue this program in the future?  
  In the future, if given the opportunity, I would very much like to continue participating in the program and will strive to contribute and learn even more.
